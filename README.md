# Face Mask Detector
A project to detect human faces in an image and tell whether he/she is wearing a mask or not.

Project to detect human faces in the image and tell whether he/she is wearing a face mask or not in order to ensure protective measures against COVID-19.

Masked and unmasked images were gathered from various sources for this purpose and in some cases the labelling of the bounding boxes was even done manually.

YOLOv3 was used for the purpose of detection because with the project of this kind the main aim is getting real time results and YOLO is the fastest because it looks at the image only once.

The results were turning out to be satisfactory.
